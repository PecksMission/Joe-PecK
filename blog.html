                <h2>Why I'm Sharing This Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    When I first thought about documenting my surgery journey online, I hesitated. This is deeply personal—why 
                    would I share something so vulnerable with the world? But then I remembered all the times I sat in doctor's 
                    offices wondering if anyone else understood what I was going through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a former medic and CVICU nurse, I've cared for countless post-surgical patients. I've monitored their 
                    vitals, managed their pain, and provided post-op care. But I've never been on the other side of it—until now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brain surgery isn't something you face lightly. It's not just a medical procedure; it's a journey that starts 
                    long before you enter the operating room and continues long after you leave. There's the diagnosis, the 
                    decision-making process, the insurance battles, the physical preparations, the emotional processing, and the 
                    constant undercurrent of fear mixed with hope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm sharing this journey because there's a gap—a gap between what healthcare providers understand about the 
                    clinical aspects of care and what patients actually experience emotionally, spiritually, and practically. I've 
                    been on both sides now, and I want to help bridge that gap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If my honesty helps one person facing surgery feel less alone, helps one caregiver understand their patient 
                    better, or helps one family member know how to support their loved one—then sharing this vulnerability is worth it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Romans 8:28 reminds us, "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who 
                    have been called according to his purpose." I believe this journey, difficult as it is, has purpose—and sharing 
                    it is part of that purpose.

                <h2>The Decision That Changed Everything</h2>
                <p>
                    "You need surgery." Four words that completely shift your world. When my neurosurgeon said them, time seemed 
                    to slow down. I knew this was a possibility—I'd done the research, I understood the progression of Chiari 
                    malformation—but hearing it out loud made it real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What struck me most was how different this felt from all the times I'd been part of similar conversations as 
                    a healthcare provider. When you're delivering the news, you're focused on being clear, compassionate, and 
                    thorough in explaining the medical rationale. But when you're receiving the news, your mind races in a 
                    thousand directions: Will I be okay? What are the risks? How long is recovery? What if something goes wrong?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got a second opinion—something I always encouraged my patients to do, and now I understand why it's so 
                    important. It wasn't about doubting my doctor; it was about needing to hear it again, to ask the questions I 
                    forgot to ask the first time, to give myself time to process before making such a monumental decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both neurosurgeons agreed: decompression surgery was necessary. My symptoms had progressed to the point where 
                    the risks of not having surgery outweighed the risks of having it. That's when I knew—it was time.
                </p>

                <h2>What No One Tells You About Pre-Surgery Life</h2>
                <p>
                    The weeks leading up to surgery have their own unique challenges that I never fully appreciated until now. 
                    Everyone talks about the surgery itself and the recovery—but the waiting period? That's its own journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are the practical preparations: pre-op appointments, blood work, medical clearances, arranging time off 
                    work, coordinating help for recovery, organizing your home for post-surgery needs. Each task is a reminder of 
                    what's coming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then there's the insurance maze. As someone who's worked in healthcare, I thought I understood the system. But 
                    navigating it as a patient—fighting for approval, coordinating benefits, understanding costs—is exhausting in 
                    its own right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But perhaps the hardest part is the emotional roller coaster. Some days I feel ready, confident even. Other 
                    days, the weight of what I'm facing feels overwhelming. And that's okay—both responses are valid and part of 
                    the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm learning that vulnerability isn't weakness. Asking for help isn't failure. And being honest about fear 
                    doesn't mean lacking faith. It means being human.
                </p>

                <h3>Lessons from Both Sides of the Bed</h3>
                <p>
                    Having been both a caregiver and now a patient preparing for major surgery, I'm noticing things I wish I'd 
                    understood better when I was on the other side:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The power of presence:</strong> You don't always need to say the right thing. Sometimes just being 
                    there is enough.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small kindnesses matter:</strong> A text checking in, an offer to help with something specific, a 
                    prayer—these aren't small things to someone facing surgery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Let patients control what they can:</strong> So much is out of our control. When someone asks our 
                    preference about anything—even something minor—honor that.</li>
                    <li><strong>Validate the emotional experience:</strong> Fear, anxiety, grief over lost abilities—these aren't 
                    obstacles to overcome; they're normal responses that need space.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hope and fear can coexist:</strong> I can be hopeful about surgery outcomes while also being scared. 
                    Both are true at the same time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I'm documenting these insights not to criticize healthcare providers—I know how hard the work is—but to help 
                    bridge the understanding gap that I now see so clearly from both sides.
