                <h3>📍 A Note to Those Experiencing These Symptoms</h3>
                <p>
                    Neurological issues are incredibly difficult to explain to people who haven't experienced them. 
                    The floating sensation, the inability to balance, the cognitive fog—these aren't things you're 
                    making up. They're real, they're valid, and they're incredibly challenging to live with.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>What is Chiari Malformation?</h2>
            <p>
                I was born with part of my brain (the cerebellar tonsils) sitting 1.5 cm lower than it should, pushed down into the space where my spinal cord is. My brain is blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)—think of it like a kink in a garden hose. The fluid can't flow properly, which causes pressure to build up and creates all kinds of neurological symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Out of 1,000 people, only 1 has Chiari. Most are asymptomatic. Of those with symptoms, most just have headaches. Surgery becomes necessary when you have ataxia (severe balance problems preventing walking) or dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).
            </p>

            <h2>Early Warning Signs I Missed</h2>
            <p>
                Looking back, the signs were there: childhood difficulty with fine motor skills, trouble picking up small objects, speech difficulties, and ADHD diagnosis. During my military entrance physical, I had balance problems. One time I got pulled over and failed a field sobriety test despite blowing zeros—I now understand it was the Chiari affecting my balance all along.
            </p>

            <h2>April 2025: When Everything Started</h2>
            <p>
                After a Monday morning hike with friends, Jesse and I went to the swings. While swinging, I started feeling dizzy and nauseous. That night at work in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit at Cox South Hospital, I still felt terrible—like motion sickness from being on a boat all day. Around midnight, I went to urgent care. They diagnosed me with BPPV (inner ear disorder), but I told them, "This is not vertigo; this is something else."
            </p>

            <h2>May-June 2025: Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
                The dizziness didn't go away. By late May, I had constant tinnitus, weird hearing, and vertigo episodes lasting minutes to an hour. I'd called out of work several times—I didn't feel comfortable walking with patients who'd just gotten open-heart surgery. My ENT ordered an MRI to rule out a tumor. In early June, good news: no tumor. But there was something else—a Chiari malformation. That same week, I went to an IMAX movie and had to lie in my car for 20 minutes before I could drive home.
            </p>

            <h2>Summer 2025: The Symptoms Get Real</h2>
            <p>
                Through June and July, my symptoms escalated: a weird "floating sensation" like I was disconnected from my feet, constant headaches, frequent nausea. The best way I could describe it was through Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb"—distant, detached, hands feeling like balloons.
            </p>

            <div class="symptoms-grid">
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>The Floating Sensation</strong>
                    <p>It's subconscious, in the back of my mind. I feel detached from what's happening—I can see people talking but can't process what they're saying. Sports became impossible due to lost hand-eye coordination.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>Morning Headaches</strong>
                    <p>I wake up with headaches every morning due to pressure increasing overnight. Caffeine helps, but they're always there.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>Cognitive Fog</strong>
                    <p>I forget words frequently, lose track of what I'm saying, blank out. My recall memory has gotten different.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                A Cine MRI in July confirmed the Chiari was blocking my spinal fluid flow. Working with CVICU patients became increasingly difficult—I had to lie down in the doctor's office multiple times. I remember looking at a pillow and it looked a mile long. I was fearful of tripping over chest tubes. My coworkers noticed something was wrong, but neurological issues are hard to understand.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box warning">
                <h3>The Invisible Illness Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    I didn't want people thinking I was making excuses. It's hard to explain that when I cough, I get a headache. When I sleep, pressure increases overnight so I wake with a headache. If I laugh too hard, headache. How do you explain feeling like you're floating, hooked to balloons? I feel like it would be easier if I had my arm blown off—something visible.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>August 2025: The Altitude Test</h2>
            <p>
                A friend and I went to Colorado. I had no symptoms hiking the Manitou Incline, making me think I was improving. But at the top of Pikes Peak, everything went wrong. It felt like someone was spinning the world really fast and I was walking sideways while drunk. The combination of elevation and Chiari severely exacerbated things. When I got back to Springfield, symptoms flared up worse than before for weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mid-August, I went to the ER during a work shift. They did a stroke test and MRI but gave no answers—just "keep waiting, work it out with a neurologist." Frustrating.
            </p>

            <h2>September-December 2025: Nashville and the Return</h2>
            <p>
                I moved to Nashville, thinking getting off night shift would help. I started working as a low-voltage contractor installing security systems. But working overhead in ceilings made everything worse—every time I looked up, pressure increased. I stumbled on stairs, getting off ladders. I had to leave because it wasn't physically safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, I felt better. I joined CrossFit East Nashville, got seven hours of sleep nightly, improved my diet. Sleep was huge—getting off night shift made a massive impact. But even with perfect sleep, I still woke with a headache every morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                In December, symptoms returned with a vengeance. Headaches more severe, floating sensation stronger, stumbling worse. I'd hoped lifestyle changes would keep them away, but Chiari doesn't work that way.
            </p>

            <h2>January 2026: The Worst Episode</h2>
            <p>
                In early January, I slept in a recliner at my friend Kevin's house. My neck got bent back while sleeping. I woke up super nauseous and couldn't walk straight—Kevin said I was running forward, propelling myself to the toilet, using walls for support. I threw up multiple times and couldn't balance on the toilet. Kevin offered to help me walk back, but hardheaded me refused. I should've gone to the hospital but didn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed difficulty swallowing in late January—a persistent sensation like "a golf ball stuck in my throat." Dry foods like crackers were particularly difficult. A swallow evaluation showed no aspiration, so I was cleared for a regular diet with strategies like adding sauces and taking small bites.
            </p>

            <h2>February 2026: Current Status</h2>
            <p>
                After a 60-hour ER stint (two CAT scans, two MRIs, swallow exam), I got a referral through the VA to a specialist. I'm currently unemployed because tilting my head up at work exacerbated symptoms. I'm someone who needs structure, and not working has been challenging. I miss patient care, being in the action, serving. I feel like my hands are tied.
            </p>

            <h2>Managing Symptoms</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>What helps:</strong> Caffeine (godsend for headaches), proper sleep position (neck straight, never flexed), massage techniques (moving pressure down, not up), and faith—knowing God has me through this pain.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Known triggers:</strong> Sleep position, looking up, altitude/pressure changes, weather, mornings (pressure increases overnight), awkward physical positions, IMAX theaters.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What surprisingly doesn't trigger symptoms:</strong> Running and lifting weights—controlled breathing, neck not flexed.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Surgery</h2>
            <p>
                As a medic, I think the best thing is to push for surgery now while I'm young, not tied to a family, no kids. There's no medication for swallowing issues or hearing loss. Physical therapy maintains symptoms but doesn't fix them. I don't want to participate in pain—I want to fix it. Let's get it done, not push this down the road. Let's be aggressive.
            </p>

            <h2>For Others Going Through This</h2>
            <p>
                One of the hardest parts is looking fine on the outside. People see a young, fit guy and think nothing's wrong. But inside, my brain is compressed and CSF isn't flowing properly. If you're struggling with people not understanding, focus on those who support you and believe you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding community has been huge. When I moved to Nashville and found Stonebridge Church, I knew I was in the right place. When symptoms flared in December, people prayed for me and offered practical help. Don't be afraid to reach out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chiari is unpredictable. I can hike a mountain and be fine but get wrecked at an IMAX. I can lift heavy weights but bending to pick up sticks throws me off. That's the nature of this condition—it doesn't mean you're doing something wrong.
            </p>

                        "My faith has been tested through all of this, but it's also been my anchor. When I don't have control over my symptoms, when I don't know what tomorrow will bring, I can trust that God has me. As Hebrews 12:11 says, 'All discipline seems painful at the time, but it brings fruit.' This season is painful, but I'm learning to depend on God in ways I never had to before."

            <p>
                My future concern isn't about after surgery—it's about not getting into surgery and suffering like this my whole life. Surgery gives me hope that I can get back to normal life, back to serving, back to being fully present.

                <h3>How I Explain It</h3>
                <p>
                    "I have a big brain. But don't worry, it's mostly smooth."
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all seriousness, my brain is under pressure because the base of my skull is smaller than it should be. It's a congenital thing I was born with, and now it's time to fix it.
