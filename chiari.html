                <h3>📍 A Personal Note</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm writing this as someone who has Chiari malformation and is preparing for decompression surgery. 
                    I'm not a doctor, but I've worked in healthcare and I'm living this experience. I'm sharing what I've 
                    learned both from the medical side and the patient side.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>What is Chiari Malformation?</h2>
            <p>
                Chiari malformation (pronounced kee-AH-ree) is a structural defect where the lower part of the brain 
                (the cerebellum) extends into the spinal canal. This happens when the skull is too small or misshapen, 
                putting pressure on the brain and forcing brain tissue downward through the opening at the base of the skull.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are different types of Chiari malformations, but Type I is the most common and is what I have. 
                It often goes undiagnosed for years—sometimes decades—until symptoms become severe enough to warrant an MRI.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a clinical perspective, it's a structural abnormality. From a patient perspective, it's life-altering.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box warning">
                <h3>⚠️ The Diagnosis Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Many people live with Chiari for years without knowing it. Symptoms can be vague and easily attributed 
                    to other conditions like migraines, anxiety, or stress. On average, it takes <strong>7+ years</strong> 
                    from first symptoms to proper diagnosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I lived with symptoms for years before getting diagnosed. Looking back, the signs were there, but they 
                    were easy to dismiss or attribute to stress, long work hours, or other causes.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Common Symptoms: What It Actually Feels Like</h2>
            <p>
                Medical literature lists symptoms, but here's what they actually feel like from someone living with them:
            </p>

            <div class="symptoms-grid">
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>Headaches</strong>
                    <p>Not just regular headaches—intense pressure at the base of the skull that gets worse with coughing, 
                    sneezing, or straining. It's the kind of pain that stops you in your tracks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>Neck Pain</strong>
                    <p>Chronic pain and stiffness in the neck and upper back that makes even simple movements uncomfortable. 
                    Sometimes it radiates down your shoulders.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>Balance Issues</strong>
                    <p>Feeling unsteady, dizzy, or like the floor isn't quite where it should be. Walking becomes something 
                    you have to think about instead of doing automatically.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>Vision Problems</strong>
                    <p>Blurred vision, double vision, light sensitivity, or seeing spots. Your eyes work fine, but the signals 
                    aren't processing correctly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>Difficulty Swallowing</strong>
                    <p>The sensation of food getting stuck, frequent gagging, or being afraid to eat certain foods because 
                    swallowing has become complicated.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>Numbness/Tingling</strong>
                    <p>Strange sensations in your hands, feet, or other body parts. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's 
                    alarming. It reminds you something is wrong.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>When Surgery Becomes Necessary</h2>
            <p>
                Not everyone with Chiari needs surgery. Some people have the malformation and never experience symptoms. 
                Others have mild symptoms that can be managed conservatively. But when symptoms progress and impact quality 
                of life—or when there's risk of permanent neurological damage—surgery becomes necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The surgery is called "decompression surgery" or "posterior fossa decompression." The goal is to create 
                more space for the brain tissue and relieve pressure. The neurosurgeon removes a small portion of bone at 
                the base of the skull and sometimes the top part of the first vertebra. Often, they also expand the covering 
                of the brain (the dura) to give everything more room.
            </p>
            <p>
                As someone who's worked in healthcare, I understand the procedure clinically. As someone about to have it, 
                I understand it emotionally, spiritually, and personally. Both perspectives matter.
            </p>

                <h3>✓ What to Know About Chiari Surgery</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>It's major surgery:</strong> This involves opening the skull. Recovery takes time and patience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Success rates are good:</strong> Most people experience significant symptom relief, though 
                    recovery varies by individual.</li>
                    <li><strong>It doesn't "cure" Chiari:</strong> Surgery relieves pressure and symptoms, but the structural 
                    abnormality remains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery is a journey:</strong> Physical healing takes weeks to months. Emotional and 
                    psychological adjustment takes time too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Each case is unique:</strong> Your experience may differ from others. That's normal.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>My Personal Journey with Chiari</h2>
            <p>
                It took me a long time to get diagnosed. I went through countless appointments, tests, and moments of 
                wondering if what I was experiencing was "real" or just stress. When I finally got answers, it was both 
                a relief and the beginning of a new, uncertain chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Living with Chiari has meant adjusting to a "new normal" multiple times—first when symptoms appeared, then 
                after diagnosis, and now as I prepare for surgery. Each phase has required adaptation, patience, and faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                The journey taught me the importance of advocating for yourself in the healthcare system. As a former 
                healthcare provider, I thought I knew how to navigate the system. As a patient, I learned that self-advocacy 
                requires a different kind of strength—asking questions when you're tired, pushing for answers when you're 
                scared, and trusting your instincts when something doesn't feel right.
            </p>

                        "Living with Chiari has taught me that chronic illness isn't just a medical issue—it's a daily reality 
                        that affects every part of life. And preparing for surgery has shown me that the patient experience 
                        includes so much more than what happens in the operating room."

            <h2>If You're Experiencing Symptoms</h2>
            <div class="info-box success">
                <h3>Steps to Take</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> Keep a detailed symptom diary with dates, triggers, and severity. 
                    This helps doctors see patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Request an MRI:</strong> Chiari can only be definitively diagnosed through brain imaging. Don't 
                    let anyone dismiss your concerns without proper testing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Find a specialist:</strong> Look for neurologists or neurosurgeons who have specific experience 
                    with Chiari malformation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Get a second opinion:</strong> For something this significant, it's worth hearing from multiple 
                    experts before making decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust yourself:</strong> You know your body. If something doesn't feel right, keep pushing for 
                    answers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Connect with others:</strong> Support groups (online and in-person) can provide invaluable 
                    information and emotional support.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>If You're Facing Surgery</h2>
            <p>
                If you've been told you need Chiari surgery, I want you to know: it's okay to be scared. It's okay to have 
                questions. It's okay to need time to process. And it's okay to ask for support.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm documenting my entire surgery journey—from decision-making through recovery—to help others understand 
                what this experience is really like. Not to frighten you, but to prepare you. Not to discourage you, but to 
                let you know you're not alone.

            <h2>Why Awareness Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Raising awareness about Chiari malformation serves multiple purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Faster diagnosis:</strong> When more people recognize the symptoms, patients can get diagnosed and 
                treated sooner.</li>
                <li><strong>Better understanding:</strong> Chiari is invisible. People who look fine may be struggling significantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare provider education:</strong> Not all doctors are familiar with Chiari. Awareness helps.</li>
                <li><strong>Community building:</strong> No one should face this alone. Community provides support, information, 
                and hope.</li>
                <li><strong>Research support:</strong> Greater awareness can lead to more funding for research into better 
                treatments and outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Resources & Support</h2>
